Google Project for Odin using basic HTML and CSS styles. 
Used some boostrap to experiment with it but didn't use it as much as I could have. 
Took some styles and colors from dev tools in chrome to make sure I had the right margins and pixels attached to them.
The website was a special website for the day and I decided to integrate the picture into that.
